# tiaa-publicfinances WP plugin
This WP plugin is intended as a minimal viable product  of the @tiaa-frm project team of tiaa-forum.org for reporting payments. It may be used as well as a staging jig for eventual features/functionality for proposed modifications to the [FormidableForms](https://formidableforms.com/) plugin. It was originally developed by @joshreisner (@josh on tiaa-forum.org).

It directly queries the frm_payments table that tracks the payments from the payment processor(s).

### TODO items (from initial creation of the repository)
1. Rewrite in object model
1. Develop documentation for expansion of WP shortcode + parameters/attributes
1. Develop interface(s) for dealing with shortcode parameters
